The local police sometimes place a radar speed detector by the side of the road; as a vehicle approaches, this detector displays the vehicle’s speed to its driver. The local residents are not convinced that such a passive method is helping the problem. They wish to persuade the village to add extra police patrols to encourage drivers to observe the speed limit. To help their case, a resident stood where he could see the detector and recorded the speed of vehicles passing it during a 15-minute period one day. When clusters of vehicles went by, he noted only the speed of the front vehicle. The data are given in `triphammer.csv`.\n",

To do this she tested four different methods—washing with water only, washing with regular soap, washing with antibacterial soap (ABS), and spraying hands with antibacterial spray (AS) (containing 65% ethanol as an active ingredient). She suspected that the number of bacteria on her hands before washing might vary considerably from day to day. To help even out the effects of those changes, she generated random numbers to determine the order of the four treatments. Each morning she washed her hands according to the treatment randomly chosen. Then she placed her right hand on a sterile media plate designed to encourage bacteria growth. She incubated each plate for 2 days at 36 °C after which she counted the bacteria colonies. She replicated this procedure 8 times for each of the four treatments.
